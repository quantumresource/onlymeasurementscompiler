# onlymeasurementscompiler

This tool was developed by Daniel Herr. It includes:
* Clifford gate simulator
* Engine for gate permutations through the circuit
* Exporter into OpenSurgery instructions

The original repository (QC_benchmark) included ProjectQ code.

This repository includes only the necessary files, and is arranged like an extension (projqext).
